Astronomer Clickstream makes it easy to send your data to Kenshoo Conversion Pixel, which was recently enhanced with Kenshoo Infinity Tag. If you follow the steps below, your data will be routed through our platform and pushed to Kenshoo Pixel in the appropriate format.

## What is Kenshoo Infinity Tag and how does it work?

Kenshoo, a global leader in agile marketing, recently released an upgraded conversion pixel that enables marketers to "better understand the role their digital campaigns played in customer transactions." The platform not only drives revenue but also improves efficiency by capturing detailed conversion data in a single platform.

Infinity Tag enhances campaign performance by moving beyond currently accepted KPIs, like total revenue, to more granular conversion and attribution insights that inform and improve organization strategy. The platform also allows retailers to share campaign details with manufacturers, which empower retailers to manage and boost co-op advertising and make a case for co-op dollars from the brand.
