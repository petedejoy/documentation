## Why send data to Resonate using Astronomer Clickstream?

Integrating Astronomer Clickstream with Resonate will circumvent the need for manual implementation.

Once your team has a better grasp of your customer base, it can effectively measure marketing performance and create engaging content.

## Getting Started with Resonate and Astronomer Clickstream

***Note:** This connector supports client-side analytics.js only.  You also need to have implemented Astronomer [inside your website](../sources/analyticsjs.md) prior to enabling this connector.*

### Resonate Side

Once you sign up on [Resonate](https://www.resonate.com/), work with a Resonate professional services director to:

- Create your company's specific campaign
- Receive your page impression, identify, and tracking `<img>` tags.

On that last note: Make sure you can identify which tags are page impression tags, and which are custom or conversion tags.

The tags will contain important parameters that you'll need.  The following parameters are the same for every tag: `advkey`, `opptykey`.  The `event key` is unique to each tag, and is shown as `my_event_key` below.  We take care of the `cache_buster`.

``` javascript
<IMG SRC="https://ds.reson8.com/insights.gif?rand=[cache_buster]&t=0&pixt=resonate&advkey=my_advkey&opptykey=my_opptykey&evkey=my_event_key&evtype=custom" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=1 BORDER=0>
```

The identify tag is a bit different, and you can extract your `User Tracking Key` from here, shown as `user_tracking_key` below.

``` javascript
<IMG SRC="https://ds.reson8.com/insights.gif?rand=[cache_buster]&t=0&pixt=resonate&advkey=my_advkey&opptykey=my_opptykey&evkey=my_event_key&evtype=custom&resnc1=esp&resnc2=open&resnc3=%%user_tracking_key%%" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=1 BORDER=0>

```

### Astronomer Side

Copy your common tag parameters (`advkey`, `opptykey`), as well as your `User Tracking Key` from the identify tag,  and paste them into your Astronomer Resonate configuration.  

Next, you'll need to provide your page impression tag event key, as well as any custom events and their respective event keys (shown as `evkey` in the snippet above).  

Give your new Resonate connection a name, and choose `Create Destination`.

### Final Step.

Confirm with your Resonate professional services director that the `<img>` tags for your specific campaign are being received as expected.
