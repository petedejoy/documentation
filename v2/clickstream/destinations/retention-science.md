## Getting Started with Retention Science and Astronomer Clickstream

### Retention Science Side

Once you have an account on [Retention Science](https://www.retentionscience.com/), work with a Retention Science account manager to:

- Create your company's specific remarketing campaign
- Identify your Site ID and tracking `<script>` tags  

*Note:* This connector supports client-side analytics.js only.  You also need to have instrumented Astronomer [inside your website](../sources/analyticsjs.md) prior to enabling this connector.

### Astronomer Side

Paste your Site ID into the `Site ID` field in your Astronomer Retention Science configuration, and give your new connection a unique name.

Check the `Enable On-Site` box, click `Create Destination` and your pipeline will be activated. 

**Custom Events & Reserved Events**

You'll notice two additional sections in our UI. Both are optional, but you can use these to map custom events to specific Retention Science events.  

*Note:* Retention Science has a list of reserved event names (`click`, `view`, `email_open`, `email_click`, `shopping_cart`, `checkout_success`, `search`) that should not be entered as custom events.  We've provided those for mapping in the Reserved Events section of our UI. 

Confirm with your Retention Science account manager that the `<script>` tags for your specific campaigns are being sent as expected.
