## PHP

This library lets you record analytics data from your PHP code. It is a little different than other server-side libraries in that PHP is a single-threaded language, meaning it only processes once language at a time.

### Getting Started with PHP

#### Step 1

Clone the PHP integration into your application directory.

```php
git clone https://github.com/astronomerio/analytics-php
```

#### Step 2

Add the following to your code to load in the library.

```php
require_once(\"/path/to/analytics-php/lib/Segment.php\");
```

#### Step 3

Initialize the module with the Source ID found in the setting sections of your Astronomer account. Note that you are only required to do this initialization once.

```php
class_alias('Segment', 'analytics');
analytics::init("ASTRONOMER_APP_ID");
```

After this initialization, you have a ready-to-use instance with all calls built in.

***Note:** We've standardized to analytics.js. If you've used a tool like [Segment](https://segment.com/) in the past, you will find that instrumenting events in Astronomer works in the exact same way.*


### Using Composer to Install the PHP Library from Github

To add the Astronomer PHP library to a PHP app using composer:

In composer.json, add the GitHub url to the repositories section and then require the library as usual.

***Note:** you need the ‘dev-‘ prefix on the version in the require section as noted in the [composer docs](https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#loading-a-package-from-a-vcs-repository).

```
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/astronomerio/analytics-php"
        }
    ],

    "require": {
        "segmentio/analytics-php": "dev-master"
    }
}

```

### Calls in PHP

Check out our [Calls](../calls.md) section for information on when you should use each call. Below are some examples of how you'd call specific objects in PHP.

#### Identify

```php
analytics::identify(array(
         "userId" => "1234qwerty",
         "traits" => array(
         "name" => "Arthur Dent",
         "email" => "earthling1@hitchhikersguide.com",
         "hasTowel" => True,)
);
```

#### Track

```php
analytics::track(array(
        "userId" => "1234qwerty",
        "event" => "Added File",
        "properties" => array(
        "fileTitle" => "Life, the Universe, and Everything",
        "fileSize" => "42kb",
        "fileType" => "PDF")
        )
);
```

#### Page

```php
analytics::page(array(
        "userId" => "1234qwerty",
        "section" => "Blog",
        "name" => "10 Questions with Marvin, the clinically depressed robot",
        "properties" => array(
        "referrer" => "http://reddit.com/r/AMA")
        )
);
```

#### Group

```php
analytics::group(array(
        "userId" => "1234qwerty",
        "groupId" => "5678dvorak",
        "traits" => array(
        "name" => "The Hitchhikers",
        "relativePosition" => "[39.1000° N, 84.5167° W]")
        )
);
```

#### Alias

```php
analytics::alias(array(
        "previousId" => "1ff049u10459u7",
        "userId" => "1234qwerty")
);
```
